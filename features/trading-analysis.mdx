- **Winning Trades**: Number of profitable trades  
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of winning trades
- **Trading P/L**: Profit/loss from trades
- **Dividend Income**: Total dividends received
- **Total Return**: Combined trading P/L and dividends

## Trade Details

Click on any profit/loss amount to see detailed trade information:

- **Symbol**: Stock ticker
- **Buy Date**: Purchase date
- **Sell Date**: Sale date
- **Buy Price**: Purchase price per share
- **Sell Price**: Sale price per share
- **Volume**: Number of shares traded

## Hybrid Matching Algorithm

The system uses a hybrid matching algorithm that combines:

1. **Broker Realized Gains/Losses** - Pre-calculated lot matches with definitive P/L
2. **Transaction History** - Complete record of all buy/sell transactions

This achieves **broker-level accuracy** for closed positions.
